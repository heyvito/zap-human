# zap-human ‚ö°Ô∏èüßç

**zap-human** is a [uber-go/zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) encoder for 
humans. It does not attempt to be performant, but readable, and **is not intended
for use in production environments**.

## Installing

Download the package:

```console
$ go get -u github.com/heyvito/zap-human
```

Then, import it for side-effects:

```go
package main

import (
	_ "github.com/heyvito/zap-human"
    "go.uber.org/zap"
    "go.uber.org/zap/zapcore"
)
```

Finally, configure your logger using `"human"` as the encoder:

```go
func main() {
    config := zap.NewDevelopmentConfig()
    config.Encoding = "human"
    config.EncoderConfig.EncodeLevel = zapcore.CapitalColorLevelEncoder
    config.DisableCaller = true
    logger, err = config.Build()
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	zap.ReplaceGlobals(logger)
}
```
